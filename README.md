Project 1: Methods For High-Dimensional Space Visualization Using Spotify Song Data
- Scrapped Spotify Song Data for multiple playlists
- Built a dataset out of the extracted information
- Used T-SNE to visualize relationships between data points in  high-dimensional spaces
- Was able to tell certain genres appart by looking at the regions where data points were more densely packed
